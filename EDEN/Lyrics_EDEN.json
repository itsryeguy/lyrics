  "plain": "Jonathon Ng (born 23 December 1995), better known by his stage name EDEN, is an Irish electronic music producer turned singer-songwriter based in Dublin, Ireland. He formerly operated as The Spab Project, and would upload random songs and projects onto SoundCloud. After he had outgrown that phase, he changed his name to The Eden Project, an alias that was discontinued in 2015. Ng\u2019s work as The Eden Project typically featured more conventional styles of electronic dance music such as dubstep and drum and bass, while EDEN saw him venturing into a more indie pop style. He made this alias change in April 2015, after the release of Final Call.\n\nIn an interview for Billboard, EDEN gives a little information about himself. He didn\u2019t enjoy his school\u2019s music subjects, yet started writing music at the early age of 7 or 8, and even performed in a band with some of his friends at the age of 13 or 14.\n\nEDEN\u2019s main inspirations are varied. He enjoyed Rihanna while at school, whereas his current musical inspiration ranges from Kendrick Lamar to even Hans Zimmer.\nSome of his previous inspiration is also credited to Freddie Mercury and Michael Jackson. EDEN\u2019s interest in Jackson can also be confirmed through his cover of Billie Jean.\n\nOn August 8th, 2015 Ng\u2019s EP End Credits was released for free download worldwide. The EP was released under Ng\u2019s own label, MCMXCV (which stands for 1995) and under UK-based label Seeking Blue Records. \u201cNocturne\u201d and \u201cGravity\u201d were both released as singles, in June and July. The whole EP got 14 million plays on Soundcloud.\n\nOn March 22nd, Ng went on the End Credits Tour, with concerts in Dublin, London, Toronto, New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The tickets were sold out within a week, and an additional venue was set up in New York City because of popular demand. The tour ended on April 8th.\n\nA little while after the End Credits Tour, Ng announced his new album,  i think you think too much of me would be released on August 19th, 2016. On June 10th his first single, \u201csex\u201d was released. About one month later, Billboard premiered the next single, \u201cdrugs\u201d a day before it\u2019s official release July 15th. A music video was later put out for \u201cdrugs\u201d on August 18th, which has about 1.6 million views on Youtube. A second music video for \u201cdrugs\u201d was put out, it was a 360 video degree video experience in VR. The video got 1.5 million Facebook views in one week. i think you think too much of me features a remake of \u201cFumes\u201d which was originally released under The Eden Project, featuring Gnash. This album features two other re-releases of The Eden Project songs, \u201cXO\u201d and a remastered version of \u201cCircles\u201d. Ng promoted I think you think too much of me through the Futurebound Tour, which started on September 7th, 2016 in Vancouver, Canada. The tour included 33 performances in North America and Europe, which concluded on November 26th with a final show in Paris, France.\nOn September 28th, 2017 Ng released his first song since his international tour, \u201cstart//end\u201d, the lead single for his upcoming album, vertigo.\n\nNg released after \u201cstart//end\u201d two more singles from vertigo, \u201cgold\u201d and \u201ccrash\u201d. On January 19th came vertigo, EDEN\u2019s debut album with 10 brand new songs. EDEN released two singles in 2018, all you need is love and about time."
