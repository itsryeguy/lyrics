[Intro]
1, 2, 3

[Verse 1]
Yeah, she's in love with the concept
As if we're all just how she imagined
'Cause we're in love, I just don't know it yet, huh
Well, tell me how am I supposed to see the magic?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I don't believe in it no more
But I won't tell her
'Cause I always imagined
It's easier if she thinks she won
So I'ma let her, and she said

[Chorus 1]
"I don't think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
Girl, I don't think you know me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
No I don't love you, and I never did
Look at us burning down in flames for kicks
But just know
I'm not singing for your XO
I'm just singing 'cause it's over
Yeah, uh, yeah

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
Came and went like the summer time
Was that a sunset or sunrise?
Looking back like, "Where'd the time go?"
So much for trying to keep this moving slow

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I don't believe in her no more
But I remember
How we talked shit like we knew what we wanted
I still remember what she said

[Chorus 2]
"I don't think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
But I don't think she knew me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
But I'm no liar, and I never hid anything
You should've seen it coming to this
Just know
I'm not singing for an ex, though
I'm just singing 'cause it's over, yeah, yeah

[Drop]

[Outro]
Uh, girl I'm just singing
I'm just singing, yeah
I'm just singing 'cause it's over

[Verse 1]
'Cause I had the best of the worst sides
And I had these lungs
And I had too many flash fires
That I just let them burn

[Pre-Chorus]
'Till my chest is on fire
And my head just won't die
I guess I'm lying 'cause I wanna
I guess I'm lying 'cause I don't
'Cause I just feel so tired
Like it's move or slowly die
You say, "You ain't you when you're like this
This ain't you and you know it"
But ain't that just the point?

[Interlude]
You don't know how to let go
Who said this must be all or nothing?
But I'm still caught below, and I'll never let you know
No, I can't tell you nothing

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
But still I could always be
Whatever you wanted
But not what you needed
Especially when you been needing me
'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
And I'll say what I don't mean
Just 'cause I wanted
Or maybe I need it
Swear lying's the only rush I need

[Verse 2]
'Cause all I needed was some words to say
That all these feelings don't mean shit to me
'Cause it's all just chemicals anyway, anyway, yeah
And I got way too many routes to take
To make this all just go away
And find another heart to break
So heartless with these words I say
Just saying what I'm supposed to say
'Cause I had nothing for you
I can't love when I can't even love myself
Things I would rather be thoughts at the back of my head
But I'm addicted to hurting
And I got these lungs
And I spent too many late nights
Just thinking a hole in the earth

[Pre-Chorus]
'Till the sky is on fire
And my head still won't die
I guess I'm lying 'cause I wanna
I guess I'm lying 'cause I don't
'Cause I just feel so tired
Like I need something to come alive
She said, "You ain't you when you're like this
This ain't you, what you doing?"
And I said, "That's the point"

[Interlude]
You don't know how to let go
Who said this must be all or nothing?
But I'm still caught below, and I'll never let you know
No, I can't tell you nothing

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
But still I could always be
Whatever you wanted, but not what you needed
Especially when you been needing me
'Cause I'm a fucking mess inside
And I'll say what I don't mean
Just 'cause I want it
Or maybe I need it
Swear lying's the only rush I need

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, oh yeah, I need it
Yeah, I need it, I need it I need it, I need it, yeah

[Verse 1]
And I said what's up?
What you been thinking?
'Cause you've been staring at that roof so long
I'd swear it's come alive
And she spoke nine words
And now we're sinking
But I can't find it in myself to want to lie
To keep this thing from going down

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause that girl took my heart
And I ain't want it back
No
I'm laying down my cards

[Verse 2]
'Cause you said it meant nothing
And I should've kept my silence
But I guess I'm too attached to my own pride to let you know
That all these words meant nothing
And I've always been this heartless
And we're just having sex, no, I would never call it love
But love

[Chorus]
Oh no, I think I'm catching feelings
And I don't know if this is empathy I feel
Just hold on
Remember why you said this was the last time?

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Whoa
So I guess it's
Whoa, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Whoa
Let die to let live

[Verse 3]
And what's good
When both choices I've got
Have us staring down the barrel to the bullets I can't stop?
And so I stand off
Like indecision's Kevlar
'Til this fear of feeling stops and I'm done
But you

[Interlude]
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you

[Pre-Chorus]
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
'Cause that girl took my heart
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
And I ain't want it back, no
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
A bulletproof restart

[Chorus]
Oh no, I think I'm catching feelings
And I don't know if this is empathy I feel
Just hold on
Remember why you said this was the last time?

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Whoa
So I guess it's
Whoa, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Whoa
Let die to let live

[Outro]
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you

[Verse 1]
I wanted you to be the last thing on my mind
I wanted you to be the reason I close my eyes
But I can't sleep
And oh God, I wanted to be your high
But everything I said, it went unheard
And everything you saw with eyes straight blurred
Became our downfall

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you say I drink and I smoke and I talk too much
But I know you lied when you said that you just gotta go and save yourself
So hear me out
You know everybody talks, girl
And it means nothing 'till you let it
But if you keep second guessing then there's only gonna be one end

[Chorus]
But you can leave if you really want to
And you can run if you feel you have to
Now I'll be fine if you ever ask me
I know it's hard, but no one said it's easy
Falling's easy
But there's only one way up

[Verse 2]
So I been thinking that I think too much
And I can't sleep, but I can dream of us
And I've been seeing shit like horror cuts
It's burning down, I gotta drown this out
And you said you need me to let this go
But it's who I am, or am I just losing it
'Cause you said jump and I went first but falling's always been my downfall

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say I drink and I smoke and I talk too much
But I know you lied when you said that you just had enough and save yourself
So hear me out
You know everybody talks, girl
And it means nothing 'till you let it
And if you keep second guessing then there's only gonna be one end

[Chorus]
But you can leave if you really want to
And you can run if you feel you have to
And I can drink if I feel I have to
I know it's hard, but I can't feel like I used to
Like I used to
'Cause I used to defy gravity
Defy gravity
Goodbyes keep dragging me
Down
And I'm fighting gravity
Defying gravity
I tried but I keep falling
'Cause falling's easy
But it only brings you down

[Intro]
It's been a few years since you been gone
There's been a few tears, but that was years and years ago
Yeah, I grew up to be exactly what you wanted
Yeah, I've been living out the dream that you dreamt up
It's been a few years with more to come
It's been a few years since I've felt sure of what I want
And I woke up today and found that you were waiting here for me and I thought
Woah, old friend, it's bittersweet
But how could you do this to me?
How could you do this to me?
Yeah

[Verse 1]
'Cause you are not who you think you are
There's no grain on these brown eyes
But they can be green if they really want
And I can bend your words
So they say exactly what hurts the most
But silence is better than fake laughs or faking we're always up
Loose grip
The world bends around you
And living through cracked screens
We fold down to what we want
Out of love
We talk through lines, we're made of smoke
And just in time, we drift away
Diffusing light, confusing times
Growing up, or cascading down?
Cascading down
I'm hurting now

[Verse 2]
But change comes slow
If you hate what's in your head, the fuck would you speak your mind?
In search of lost time
Just 21, so I'm young and I'm stupid
Only 16, yeah, I think you should've known
I think you fucked me up
I think, I think you fucked me up
And I've got nothing to say to you

[Outro]
It's been a few years and I moved on
Couldn't make it disappear, oh I tried so hard to be strong
But I grew up today and faced that I'm not just lonely
Don't feel much better but I guess that it's a start

[Verse 1: EDEN]
The morning light shines a lifeline
Escape is what I need
I should've listened last night, girl
This is beyond belief
That we keep falling for the lure of
Liquid confidence and lies
And we skydive from walls we built
Dying just to feel alive

[Pre-Chorus: EDEN]
On the way down screamin'

[Chorus: EDEN]
Whoa
If all we have is time, then we'll be alright
It's not much, but it's better than nothing (Whoa)
We're running on fumes, but we'll make it through the night
It's not love, but it's better than dreaming

[Verse 2: EDEN]
Oh, I'm on fire
There's a burning in my bones and in my eyes
These dreams, they're taking hold, I just need time
Time

[Verse 3: gnash]
Building walls to burn them down
Cannonballs to watch me drown
You've got me lost in here and now
You've got me gone and lost and found
We only hang in evenings
And I don't know what I'm thinking
But I know that I won't think it
If I keep up with this thinking
All these dreams and all these plans
We shared under the moonlight
They're dreams and plans that I have
I just don't know if you'll fit right
When I leave in the morning
And I kiss you and say goodnight
I kick myself until we kick it
Should've told you goodbye
Coming home so late at night
With clothes covered in sand
I don't know just what I'm missing
But I'm doing what I can
And if all we have is time then we will find

Interlude:
Boy you are in a hurry!
If you were lookin' at what I'm looking at you'd be in a hurry too

[Chorus: EDEN]
Whoa
If all we have is time, then we'll be alright (Whoa)
It's not much, but it's better than nothing (Whoa)
We're running on fumes, but we'll make it through the night (Whoa)
It's not love, but it's better than dreaming
Whoa
If all we have is time, then we'll be alright (Whoa)
It's not much, but it's better than nothing (Whoa)
We're running on fumes, but we'll make it through the night (Whoa)
It's not love, but it's better than dreaming

[Verse 1]
You try to kill it but it won't stop bleeding
Try to forget it but it won't stop killing you
You're running out of time
Yeah, you know you can't go back
It's too late
To say it's too late
You can't take back that you said nothing
How could you do nothing?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is this burning right?
Am I living bridges?
Can we build our past right?
Learning through future solecism

[Chorus 1]
(I've missed times) It's played out
(Been disconnected) I've moved on
(I stressed time) Get fucked up
(Forgetting timing) My new draw
(And I need you to talk me down) And it's not right
You're dead wrong ('cause I feel like I need to crash)
What are we doing?
Let's go home
There's no hope
It's all wrong

[Bridge]
'Cause I've been looking at the sky to show me where I went wrong
Been looking at the sky like someone was looking down
But it keeps raining on me
And I've been looking at the sky since I was like 5 years old
Been looking for the stars but it seems like they're all gone
And the fault's not ours alone
But I think it's time to go

[Chorus 2 (Over Bridge)]
It's played out
I've moved on
Get fucked up
My new draw
And it's not right
You're dead wrong
What are we doing?
Let's go home
There's no hope
It's all wrong

[Verse 2]
And I've got way too many questions just to try and get it right
'Cause I can't be the one to shrug it off
And I could be the reason that we stay up all night
To be someone, to be someone
And oh, all we've got is to try to get it right
But no one told you
That this gon' hurt, oh no
And now all I really want is to scream
Now all I really want is to scream
Now all I really want is to scream
Now all I really want is to scream

[Verse 3]
That shit just to try and find a way to get my head down
And head out or maybe just the two of us and head now
I'm just tryna find the real now
Dream clouds, ghost ground
Real friends, dead hometown

[Bridge]
'Cause I've been looking at the sky to show me where I went wrong
Been looking at the sky like someone was looking down
But it keeps raining on me
When I been looking at the sky since I was like 5 years old
Been looking for the stars but it seems like they're all gone
And it breaks my heart, you know
But I think it's time to go

[Chorus 2 (Over Bridge)]
It's played out
I've moved on
Get fucked up
My new draw
And it's not right
You're dead wrong
What are we doing?
Let's go home
There's no hope
It's all wrong

[Verse 1]
And if I told you how this story ends
Would you change a step you take?
And if I could relive all of my days
I'd live them all the same
'Cause I'm scared
Of all that I don't know
'Cause I want it all, but all of it ain't gold
And I'm scared
But I know it's not for long
'Cause I'm learning what I should've long before

[Chorus]
That all we are
Is a light into the darkness
And all we are
Is time that's counting down
And all we are
Is falling through the spaces in between
Endless flight
A lifetime in repeat

[Verse 2]
But I still find solace
When you say
That you know how I feel
When it's wrong
And we ain't been right for years
And let go
Give these ghosts a new home
And let's bury our past and our fears and all these bones
And let's go
I should've seen it long before
'Cause this is my life
I will not run in circles
Ending where I start

[Bridge]
So hold on to me
We'll burn out slowly
And feel our hearts leap
To words we don't mean

[Verse 3]
Love
Means nothing to me
'Cause I don't know what it is
I'm just dying to be
All that I've been dreaming of
And words betray me
Contradict all I stand for
But I'm still learning
Yeah, I'm still learning

[Chorus]
That all we are
Is a light into the darkness
And all we are
Just time that's counting down
And all we are
Is falling through the spaces in between
Endless flight
We're falling to our knees

[Intro]
Don't know how well this is gonna be
But, the basic idea is-

[Verse 1]
Free fall for now
Desert air won't drown you out
And for a second I thought the world was ending
And I couldn't breathe in
Yeah, and so this isn't your time
Yeah, been chasing kairos with those scapegoat eyes
Can't you realize?
Fuck the summertime, it's you
So scared of overgrowing youth
When it's not done with you

[Chorus]
And everybody gon' run, run
Everybody gon' run, run
And you can call it what you want
But I call it moving on
And I'm so done with singing words I don't believe in no more

[Verse 2]
So what you rushing for?
Who said it's now or never?
I think you're taking on the wrong advice
But it's alright if these are your worst times
You know you're good
You're good

[Interlude]
And if you want you can breathe on your own
This isn't what I thought but it's beautiful
Make peace with your mistakes and they'll turn to gold
Weightless, I let  go

[Chorus]
And everybody gon' run, run
Everybody gon' run, run
And you can call it what you want
But I call it moving on
And I'm so done with singing words I don't believe in no more

[Outro]
No more, call it what you want
Call it what you want but I call it growing up and I'm done

[Intro]
And I know I've been closing myself off, unsure
I know I've been real hard to reach, harder to love
And I know it's tiring, this shit is getting old

[Pre-Chorus]
But please, just hold on to me
I've slayed these demons, they're old to me
Recurring dreams, this is happening
Tearing my seams; lucid reality

[Chorus]
And I just want you to feel love (love!)
Before it disappears (not!)
'Cause we are more than we're not (wrong!)
So never fear to feel (brave!)
Good when everything's wrong (love!)
And find some beauty there (not!)
'Cause all we ever are is brave (brave!)
And your world's not ending, ooh

[Verse]
So I won't go
I'm still living in the middle of a one-way war
I can't fight it but I'm trying to be what you want, yeah
You can't sing but you're singing this anyway
And anyway, so please just hold on to me
This is no end, we're not finished here
Finding our way, we're just changing
Becoming more than I think of me, yeah
These fears in my head, dreams in my bed
They won't get the best of me, yeah
'Cause I chase dreams 'till the end
These nightmares all bend
Silver linings are all I need

[Pre-Chorus]
So, please, just hold on to me
I've slayed these demons, they're old to me
Recurring dreams, this is happening
Tearing my seams from reality

[Chorus]
And I just want you to feel love
Before it disappears
'Cause we are more than we're not
So never fear to feel
Good when everything's wrong (love!)
And find some beauty there (not!)
'Cause all we ever are is brave

[Verse 1]
And this is just another sad song
I can't deny that I've been needing one
And that the world is always at fault
And we did nothing, how did we do wrong?
And I've been thinking that when we thought
The world would break us that we weren't wrong
But it's just never been the world outside
And sonder kinda has me terrified

[Verse 2]
And I'm so sorry I can't find the time
Spent all my days over-preoccupied
And I've been thinkin' 'bout how I'd react
If you were me and I was ghosted out
And I know I should try more
But I've been so caught in my own small shit that I can't see
Past the nothing around me here

[Outro]
But I've been trying really fuckin' hard not to try so hard
Really fuckin' hard to just let go
Really fuckin' hard not to try so hard
And realize I've nowhere left to go

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Last night was a car crash
Highlights meet a quick end
Live the high life 'fore the weekends
Coming down hard to the sunset sinking in
Didn't try hard for a diehard
Nothing I can say that you won't get wrong
And everybody asks where you're gone now
Can you only really want what you don't have enough?
Everything you ever wanted adding up
To be the reason you can't stand it now
You talk a lot, well act like it
Finally found a way to get myself untangled
And undone, but it's alright
This ain't been the dream in a long time
Make sure you play the music when my time's up
Oh, just say it, I'm done

[Chorus]
So if you loved me, how was I supposed to know?
'Cause now we're fading and losing what we wanted most
But in spite of how you feel, it's not the end of the world
Some say these things are for the best
How are you so sure?

[Verse 2]
And you can find me where the sea pours into the stars
I'll get there someday
I hope you find everything you think that you want
Bruises will fade
Time on our side, we can wait for it
I'll be doing fine, if you are
'Cause life is but a dream
Only as real as you let it be

[Chorus]
So if you loved me, how was I supposed to know?
'Cause now we're fading and losing what we wanted most
But in spite of how you feel, it's not the end of the world
Some say these things are for the best
For better or worse

[Verse 1]
So this is how I die now
Hands to the air
No, they can't stop the sky falling down, down
Guess I thought that I'd feel good somehow, how
When all you know is up, it's hard not to feel like you ain't going down, down

[Verse 2]
Disappearing through the silence
Screams fade and blur
Conversating with a smile, though
Life invisible
Guess I thought that I'd feel better now
Somehow, anyhow
So now

[Pre-Chorus]
Icarus
No, I can't escape this fall
Falling in reverse
Falling in reverse

[Chorus]
So how you gonna scream my name
When I gave all I got?
I've nothing left to give you
And I'm so burnt out and lost
'Cause it all just feels the same
And I got all I want
I had you where I wanted
I guess I don't know
How to live with a good thing
And not break it into nothing
Self destruct just to feel, or so it goes

[Verse 3]
One (Thank you so much, guys)
So tell me how you want me here now
Keep crying down the phone
Yeah, that's all I seem to hear now
Keep lying through your teeth
Lie to me, lie with me now
(I'm halfway there, but it's like, shit, I haven't really been doing anything for the last year. And it's insane that I've been doing a shit ton but like, in terms of... I don't know.)

[Verse 4]
So tell me how you really feel now
Ain't been asked that in a while
Yet you still hope that they'll hear you out
Just keep at it, bro, these things always seem to fix themselves somehow
Suck it up, some would kill just to stand
Where you're standing now

Icarus
No I can't escape this fall

[Chorus]
So how you gonna scream my name
When I gave all I got?
I've nothing left to give you
'Cause I'm so burnt out and lost
'Cause fuck it, it all feels the same
And I got all I want
I thought that I'd feel something
Guess I'll never know
How to live with a good thing
Fucked my life up for nothing, nothing
'Cause you don't care if I'm still bleeding
You just scream until you hear my name

[Outro]
So this is how I die now
Hands to the air
No, they can't stop that sky falling down, down
Guess I thought that I'd feel good somehow
Disappearing through the silence
Screams fade and blur
Conversating with the smile, though
Life invisible
Guess I thought that I'd feel better now
Somehow, anyhow
By now

[Intro]
If you fall, I'll catch you

[Verse 1]
So I've been thinking 'bout something
Lately I've been alive
'Cause I found my reason in nothing
So I won't close my eyes
'Cause I don't want to miss one second
And I don't want to feel so cold
And I don't want to be so sad that we are who we are
'Cause we had no control

[Pre-Chorus]
But only by the night
Will we ever make headlines
Will we ever make things right
When we've only ourselves to blame
When we've only ourselves to blame

[Chorus]
So I won't sleep
No more
No, I won't sleep
No more
I won't sleep
I always thought that there'd be more than just wishing my life away
No more
Like I could always
No DMT won't stop me
Figure it out and never have to abandon what's in front of me
Dream
No more
(Dream no more)

[Verse 2]
So get this doubt out of my head
It's only real if you let it
And I've been letting go of my ghosts
I'll never let them catch me no more
But these words are all I have
So I'll just keep dreaming out loud
And if I just keep talking
Maybe I'll figure all this out

[Pre-Chorus]
But only by the night
Will we ever make headlines
Will we ever make things right
When we've only ourselves to blame
And we've only ourselves to blame

[Chorus]
So I won't sleep
No more
No, I won't sleep
No more
I won't sleep
I always thought that there'd be more than just wishing my life away
No more
Like I could always
No DMT won't stop me
Figure it out and never have to abandon what's in front of me
Dream
No more

[Intro]
I can't find you
But can't fault you, 'cause I
Can get so caught up in my own head
You just float through, I can't catch you
And I can understand but can't face the feeling
That I'm just another end

[Chorus]
So when you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you

[Verse]
But I can float too, and I don't ask for much from you
And maybe that's too much, too soon
So I, keep rolling through the blackout
No fires without some fallout
Made peace out of the pieces
Now I can't take it back now, no
But I keep on track now up
And yeah, that's all of it
I gave up my youth for this 'cause I wanted it, and
If you think that I need you then you're out of your head
But I want you

[Bridge]
So bring me down and drown me out
I'll be waiting here when you're ready
And I'll lay me down, unfinished now
It hurts

[Chorus]
So when you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you

[Refrain]
Come back to you, come back to you
Oh, it's always you, gon' come back to you
Come back to you, gon' come back to you, yeah
Come back to you

[Bridge]
So bring me down and drown me out
I'll be waiting here when you're ready
And I'll lay me down, unfinished
Yeah, yeah, oh

[Chorus]
When you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to, if you let me
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you

[Outro]
"There you go Jonathon that's another problem solved"

[Verse]
But I could be more
Isn't there more?
Don't you dream of forgetting this?
Have we forgotten what we want?
Counting the wars and broken bones
Haven't we lost enough already?
Isn't this more than what it's worth?
Have we forgotten where we came from?
Long way from laying in the dirt
And if I can only dream of up from down there
God, help me, I'll be gone
Have I lost sight of everything I've worked for?
Did I get this all wrong?

[Verse 1]
Of course I'm scared
Would I be thinking straight if I wasn't?
Of course I'm scared sometimes
Even if I say it don't phase me
Or if I say I'm not hazy
But drowning ain't so bad
'Cause at least you know where you're going
And we're all future bound
So I guess that's really the same thing

[Chorus]
But I always liked the thought of maybe being a runaway
I could be your lover and you could be my heartache
I could sing the songs that we used to sing when we were kids
Maybe that could bring us back to before we got stuck in that place

[Verse 2]
I want to be like John Dillinger
Just try and catch me if you can
And we could drive off in the sunset
Even if it's not the plan
'Cause plans are overrated
'Cause you never really know where you're going
And the past is always changing
Ain't been gold since I remembered it that way

[Chorus]
But I always liked the thought of maybe being a runaway
I could be your lover and you could be my heartache
And I could sing the songs that we used to sing way back when
The future wasn't everything and we lived because we loved it then
Oh, I'm going back
Catch me if you can

[Verse 1]
I'll say it once for the Bayside
I come alive when the light dies
Overcast but we're inside
Eyes wide, lied twice
My advice don't mean shit tonight
'Cause I've been driving though I can't see shit and I've
Been lying through my teeth just to get the feeling right
And feel alright
So girl just turn the lights down
Yeah
And too many times I've been caught up when I know better
So I push it back down 'cause I never want to let it out
But I've been dying since I saw you were gone
Forget me 'cause I ain't waiting for no-one
'Cause I ain't waiting for no-one

[Verse 2]
And I've been trying to dig my way out of the ocean
And punch a hole in the sky
And flood the light through to midnight
And I don't know where you're going
You can't expect the past to repeat with the ending changed
So don't forget where you came from
And we are never alone
Drops making waves in the ocean

[Outro]
(Phone rings...)
Hello?
Hello?
Can you hear me?
Ok...

[Verse 1]
But she was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Oh mama, what do you mean I am the one?"
She said I am the one
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Go and dance on the floor in the round
(I don't even know if I can tell you)

[Pre-Chorus]
And the people always told me, be careful what you do
And don't you go round breaking young girls' hearts
My mother always told me, be careful who you love
And be careful what you do because a lie becomes a truth

[Chorus]
And Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who thinks that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
So take my strong advice
(Don't think twice) Don't think twice
She told me, "Baby, we'd danced 'till three"
Then she looked at me
She showed me a photo of a baby crying
His eyes looked like mine
Go and dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, be careful what you do
And don't you go around breaking young girls' hearts
But she came and stood right by me
And she smelled of sweet perfume
And this happened much too soon
And she brought me to her room, yeah

[Chorus]
And Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who thinks that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
But the kid is not my son
(Son)
She says I am the one

[Verse 1]
I don't follows fighting for a lost cause
Feel like even drifting, we're just off course

[Chorus]
Or is it no good?
What are we if dying for?
What are we lying for, oh, if it's no good?
Good, what would you call it?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Mind if I don't end this dying (I don't follows fighting for a lost cause)
If it's worth it, you would know (Feel like even drifting, we're just off course)

[Verse 3]
Oh, it stops, all the faking, it's all fire
No flame can absolve sin
Oh, it's nothing
I'll get sullen, when I get sober
Despite my best, you keep calling


[Outro]
You got something I don't want to miss out on
I don't leave you over your stead
Would you call that love?
Love
Love
Love, love
You call that love?
Love
Love, love
Would you call that love?
Love
Love, love
All that love
Love
Love, love

Boy, you're in a hurry
If you were lookin' at what I'm looking at, you'd be in a hurry too

Y'know how everyone's saying "seize the moment?"-
Can't you feel it?
-I dunno, I'm kinda thinking the moment seizes us

[2015]
And if these days were living encores, encore
Then and tell me, do you scream?
Even when every thing's a nightmare
It's something we've all seen
'Cause we let everyone we love fall down
Like a lead sky brings the night
And that's all we are
'Cause we get off on hiding everything we are
So tell me you love me
I will too
So tell me you loath me
I do too

[2011]
And I been thinking that
The more I grow
The more that I'll lose touch with what I love, and time it flows
So much faster than anything I've ever known
I've always been a dreamer
So what happens when I wake up?
I'm not afraid of growing older
I'm just afraid of letting go

[2017]
Um, I usually write a poem for each body of work I do
Or just randomly too, I guess
But yeah, here it is:
Stop
You are not broken
There is no fix
There is a change
You are not your job, your significant other, the numbers in your bank account, the thoughts or the memories in your head
What ever anyone says: whatever
You are the words you speak, the way you move
This can change at any time as you decide
Choose wisely
Does your love mean anything if I can't feel it?
If I threw myself off a building am I a martyr or a tragedy?
However you may feel momentarily, only two factors persevere:
Your relationship to the people around you, and your view of yourself
You could buy that x if you wanted to
But think about it, if you came home like you did would it change a thing?
You are inconstant, dynamic
You're a star darling, act like one
Take care of the ones that you love
Stop being so serious
Now is not forever
But you knew all this, deep down
Maybe we are forever ending where we started
But it is only the end if you want it to be
Everything is only ever what you would like it to be;
Never as great or as grave as it seems
No matter how close or how impossibly far you think you got to that greener grass
We just have to try again
We just have to try again

[Intro]
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Ooo, oh
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

[Verse 1]
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy, ooo

[Verse 2]
There's nothing you can make that can't be made
(Nothing you can't...)
There's no one you can save that can't be saved
(Saved...)
There's nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you
It's easy, yeah

[Chorus]
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love, love
Love is all you need

[Outro]
All you need is love
(Love, love, love)
All you need is love
(Love, love, love)
All you need is love
(Love, love, love)
Love is all you need
Love is all I need
Love is all I need
Love is all I need

Alright, let's start with the word "start," alright?
One, two, three
"Start!"
That's pretty sick though, alright
Alright, next one, next one
Okay, this-
Now is the word "end" alright?
So one, two, three
"End!"
Sick, alright, what else we got?
Okay, "love"
One, two, three
"Love!"
"Not," one, two, three
"Not!"
No, not that
Two more words to go guys, alright?
Next word is "wrong," so one, two, three
"Wrong!"
Hell yeah
And last one is "brave"
So, one, two, three
"Brave!"
Thank you so much guys
Who knows? Hopefully that worked and you'll end up on a song

[Verse 1]
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so and this I know for sure
But does she really want it
But can't stand to see me walk out the door?
Don't try to fight the feeling
Cos the thought alone is killing me right now
And thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking to together cos we don't know how

[Chorus]
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya

[Verse 2]
You think you got it
Oh, you think you got it
But "got it' just don't get it when there's nothing at all
We get together
Oh, we get together
But separate's always better when's there's feelings involved
If what they say is "nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes love the exception?
And why-o, why-o, why-o
Why-o, why-o ,why-o
Are we so in denial
When we know we're not happy here, yeah

[Chorus]
But hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya

[Outro]
I'm too cool, I'm too cool for this
I'm too cool, I'm too cold for this
I'm too cold, I'm too cool for this
I'm too cool, I'm too cold for this
I'm too cool, I'm too cold for this
I'm too cool
I'm too cold

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
And just one moment
Is all I ask for
Just one talk between us
And just one second now
Some perfect clarity
And eighty hours alone

[Pre-Chorus]
And I swore to god that I wouldn't cry
And I swore to you I can't see
How it's anything more than a lie

[Chorus]
And all these years
I won't ever let them go
All my fears
They'll bring me down, down so low
And I'll be missing you
For a lifetime
But eighteen years are better than none
Until the time comes for me
To turn to dust

[Verse 2]
So I'll get on fine
My mind turned inside out
I've always found it easy
To hide these thoughts of mine
A collapsing state of mind
I'll sink to where thoughts can't find me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I swore to god that I wouldn't cry
And I swore to you I can't see
How it's anything more than a lie

[Chorus]
And all these years
I won't ever let them go
All my fears
They'll bring me down, down so low
And I'll be missing you
For a lifetime
But eighteen years are better than none
Until the time comes for me
To turn, to turn

[Verse 3]
And we all hurt
And time heals nothing at all
Decisions made and they cut me off
From all I've ever known
And I can't think
No, I can't breathe
I can't be what I want to with this weight on me

[Bridge]
I wish I had
Selective amnesia
To keep you away from me

[Chorus]
But I'll be missing you
For a lifetime
But eighteen years are better than none
Until the time comes for me
To turn to dust

[Verse 1]
Speaking of another life
I can't unfold our
Heartbreak from another time
Four seconds too long
In my head I get caught, I suppose
Just wishing I won't let her mind
Alright

[Pre-Chorus]
So we can fly away
Wondering way out loud 'till my thoughts say so
Just to ride the wave
I think I move too fast, enough to take it slow

[Chorus]
'Cause I'll just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, falling
And I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, running, tripping
I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, falling
But maybe I'll get somewhere, fast, fast

[Verse 2]
'Cause speaking of another lie, just to make times last
'Cause speaking of another love died, all just typecast
Say I fall in love too fast
For my own good
Good, good, good

[Pre-Chorus]
We can run away
I'll move 'till I die, enough to take it slow
Just to ride the wave
We're moving too fast, enough to take

[Chorus]
'Cause I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, falling
And I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, running
And I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, falling
But maybe I'll get somewhere, fast, fast

Sex, drugs, and rock & roll
Is all I want
Something more than superficial
Is all I want
The sound of the words you know
Is all I want
Sex, drugs, and rock & roll
Is all I want

Whoa-oa

This series is called three-hundred and sixty-five times.
This video is called twenty.
So... Where do i begin?

I guess since this is the first time I've done this, I'll start with the basics.
You all know me as EDEN, and by the time you're watching this I will  be twenty years old.

It's funny how you don't realize how much things have changed until you've stopped to look back. I never had a euphoric moment where I thought "This is it. Everything is about to change.", no.. that doesn't happen, but still somehow, here i am three-hundred and sixty-five days later, wondering if a turning point even exists.

And, that's not to say nothing eventful has happened this year, either.
I dropped out of school, I released some music, and somehow that allowed me to travel a bit, even though I've never even played a show.
I made some new friends, and team EDEN now has more than one member, with the addition of my manager and lawyer back in Autumn.

So, what does that mean?
Am I gonna start making different music?
Absolutely not.
Is my manager gonna start posting or tweeting for me?
Absolutely not.
I mean, I started this on my own so that I could do what I want, how I want, when I want, and that's never gonna change. I own my future.
And, speaking of which, although I think this has been the most significant year of my life so far, 2015 has only scratched the surface of what I want to do.
I have more plans than you can imagine.

So, 2016....
Where do I begin?

It's been a long year. I guess most people of my 2016 has been defined by 2 things - My first ever piece of music for sale, and well, this.

['Sofie Letitre - I'll Be Fine (ZES Remix)' plays]

But really there was so much more to it than that.
I know you've probably read this in some fucking interview or something I've done or live streamed before, but like, I feel... for a long time I felt in the same place as End Credits, you know?
And so... I think you think too much of me is one way to get around that, but I really... You know, I just want to regress, I don't feel like I have - I'm halfway there but it's like 'shit I haven't really been doing anything for the last year.' And I've been saying I've been doing a shit ton but like, in terms of... I don't know.
The fall of last year I've been living in my fucking head 1000 miles in the sky not really 'in it' I guess. It's good to just get back down to earth. Wow that's really fucking... hipster or whatever, you know what I mean.
In terms of music though honestly it's been kind of hit and miss. I feel like I got a lot of cool shit I want to make and say, but it's - I don't think I'm in the right place right now.
Like I'm having cool ideas that I know and like a lot of shit that I want to achieve, and I mean like things I want to say but I don't think I'm in the right place right now. So I'm cool with just kicking it back and laying it easy. I just don't feel like it's connecting fully right now. I'm not even back for like 2 weeks and I was gone all in the last week and I'd be gone in London again in the next week, so I'm not really in the zone. Just gonna grow up a bit in the next month or two or four or five or whatever and it'll happen eventually. I don't know. Buuuuuuut I forget what else I was gonna say.

You've been confusing since the day I met you
Another night chasing, this feels like home
Since I've been miles away from change
Outside or inside looking dazed
Just wash the glitter off your face and go home

And this enthralling shadow's gone, ghost town
It's strange to think that we were strangers once
It's square one
I guess it's something where I want more than I've got
But I can't ask you for the things you don't feel

Don't
Cause I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
Don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles to save us
I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say

And I'll still be here
It's easy when you've nothing to lose
And I'll still be there
Cause I've got no hope

Yeah
She told me love me fast or take it slow
I said I'm going nowhere fast as hell
And keeping with the times we gotta keep it on the low
Midnight habits burning through the summer since the snow and
I finally feel myself again
It's been so long, I thought I'd see the end
I guess you need ends to begin again
Again, again

Cause this is nothing we ain't seen before
Lived through it I ain't overdosed
The sky is falling like it always does
Can't you see a storm's watching over us
Let it rain
The clouds look heavy, but they bare no weight
Scars can't hurt you, bruises will fade

Don't
Cause I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
Don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles to save us
I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say

And I'll still be here
It's easy when you've nothing to lose
And I'll still be there
Cause I've got no hope

Don't
Cause I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
Don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles to save us
I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say

[Snippet]
Eyes fixed on the ground
Am I holdin' you up?
No talkin' through
Nowhere for the sing-
