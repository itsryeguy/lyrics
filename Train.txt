[Verse 1]
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey

[Chorus 1]
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Verse 2]
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mmm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

[Chorus 2]
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Bridge]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

[Breakdown]
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet? (Feet)
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day (Light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?

[Chorus 1]
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself?

[Outro]
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
And did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day?
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
And did you fall for a shooting star?
Fall for a shooting star?
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
And are you lonely
Looking for yourself out there?

[Intro]
Heyy
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey

[Verse 1]
Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

[Interlude]
Heyy
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey

[Verse 2]
Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

[Bridge]
The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be, with me

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do tonight
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

[Outro]
Heyy
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey
Tonight
Heyy
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey
Tonight

[Verse 1]
My heart is paralyzed
My head was oversized
I'll take the high road like I should
You said it's meant to be
That it's not you, it's me
You're leaving now for my own good

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

[Hook 1]
She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

[Verse 2]
My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)
She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur?

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

[Hook 2]
She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

[Bridge]
I wanna live a thousand lives with you
I wanna be the one you're dying to love...
But you don't want to

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

[Hook 1]
She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies

[Hook 2]
She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

[Chorus]
Play that song
The one that makes me go all night long
The one that makes me think of you
That's all you gotta do

[Verse 1]
Hey mister DJ when you gonna spin it
My baby's favorite record
She been waiting for a minute
She invited all her friends
And I'm buying all the rounds
And they're all dolled up
DJ please don't let me down

When you gonna play that song, now
When you gonna earn that pay
When you gonna play that song
And make my day

She said

[Chorus]
Play that song
The one that makes me go all night long
The one that makes me think of you
That's all you gotta do
Hey

[Chorus 2]
Play that song
The one the makes me stay out till dawn
The one that makes me go "ooh"
That's all you gotta do

[Verse 2]
Hey Mr. guitar
When you gonna strum it
My girl just heard this song
And you should play it cause she loves it
Can you get me off the hook
Get them fingers picking now
I'll throw some money in your cup
Mister please don't let me down

When you gonna play that song, now
Why you gotta hesitate
When you gonna play that song
And make my day

She said

[Chorus]
Play that song
The one that makes me go all night long
The one that makes me think of you
That's all you gotta do
Hey

[Chorus 2]
Play that song
The one the makes me stay out till dawn
The one that makes me go "ooh"
That's all you gotta do

[Bridge]
Oh

Moo-oo-oove Moo-oo-oove
Moo-oo-oove Wait till you see my baby moo-oo-oove
Moo-oo-oove Moo-oo-oove

Oh come on now

[Chorus]
Play that song
The one that makes her go all night long
The one that makes her think of me
That's all you gotta do
Hey

[Chorus 2]
Play that song
The one the makes me stay out till dawn
The one that makes me go "ooh"
That's all you gotta do
Oo oo oo oo
Oo oo oo oo

She doesn't own a dress
Her hair is always a mess
If you catch her stealin' she won't confess
She's beautiful

Smokes a pack a day
No wait, that's me, but anyway
She doesn't care a thing about that, hey
She thinks I'm beautiful
Meet Virginia

She never compromises
Loves babies and surprises
Wears high heels when she exercises
Ain't that beautuiful
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to be the Queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Pulls her hair back as she screams
"I don't really wanna be the Queen"

Daddy wrestles alligators
Mama works on carburetors
Her brother is a fine mediator
For the President
And here she is again on the phone
Just like me hates to be alone
We just like to sit at home
And rip on the President
Meet Virginia, Mmmm...

Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her life
Pulls her hair back as she screams
"I don't really wanna live this life"
No mama
No mama
No mama
No mama

She only drinks coffee at midnight
When the moment is not right
Her timing is quite, unusual
You see her confidence is tragic
But her intuition magic
And the shape of her body?
Unusual

Meet Virgina
I can't wait to
Meet Virginia
Yeah e yeah hey hey hey

Well she wants to be the queen
And she thinks about her scene
Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her life
Pulls her hair back as she screams
"I don't really wanna be the queen"
I, I don't really wanna be the queen
I, I don't really wanna be the queen
I, I don't really wanna live this

[Verse 1]
Forever can never be long enough for me
Feel like I've had long enough with you
Forget the world now we won't let them see
But there's one thing left to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that the weight has lifted
Love has surely shifted
My way

[Chorus]
Marry me, today and everyday
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe
Say you will, mmhm, say you will, mmhm

[Verse 2]
Together can never be close enough for me
Feel like I am close enough to you
You wear white and I 'll wear out the words "I love you"
And "you're beautiful"

[Pre-Hook, with variation]
Now that the wait is over
Love has finally shown her
My way

[Chorus]
Marry me, today and everyday
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe
Say you will, mmhm, say you will, mmhm

[Bridge]
Promise me, you'll always be
Happy by my side
I promise to sing to you
When all the music dies

[Chorus]
Marry me, today and everyday
Marry me
If I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe
Say you will, mmhm, say you will, mmhm

[Outro]
Marry me, mmhm

[Intro: Pat Monahan]
When I ride by myself, I don't ever get no help
But when I roll up with her, everybody calls me sir
No matter how long I stay, they never ever know my name
But when I walk in with her, everybody calls me sir

[Verse 1: Pat Monahan]
Northern California, same old Friday night
I tend to be invisible underneath these city lights
Then I met my baby, felt like I struck gold
Now they treat me like royalty everywhere I go
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus: Pat Monahan]
When I ride by myself, I don't ever get no help
But when I roll up with her, everybody calls me sir
No matter how long I stay, they never ever know my name
But when I walk in with her, everybody calls me sir

[Post-Chorus: Pat Monahan]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Call me sir
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Cam]
I ain't goin' nowhere unless he's there with me
'Cause I don't stand in line no more, admission's always free
He could break the law, he could break your heart in two
But I promise that you won't care when he smiles at you
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus: Pat Monahan & Travie McCoy]
When I ride by myself, I don't ever get no help
But when I roll up with her, everybody calls me sir
No matter how long I stay, they never ever know my name
But when I walk in with her, everybody calls me sir (Come on)

[Post-Chorus: Pat Monahan & Travie McCoy]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Call me sir
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh (Ha-ha)
Call me sir
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh (Come on, hey, Pat)
Call me sir (Heh-heh-ha!)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh  (Yo!)
Something about her man
She makes me feel like a million bucks, bruh
Oh-oh, oh-oh (It's Trav; what it do?)

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
Every time we hit the streets it's like a world premier
She makes me feel like Sia swinging from that chandelier (Wait for 'em)
Went from marginally famous to the top of the A-list
And just for future reference, here's a tip Mr. Belvedere:
Never judge a book by it's cover (No)
And never judge an ugly duckling by his mother (Uh-uh)
The frog prince got kissed, her lips granted his wish
It's a sad world when your net worth determines your lover, but (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah; yo soy sad)
What would I ever do without you, huh?
I prolly wouldn't have a clue without you
But one thing's for sure: when I pull up with her
Don't refer to me as Travie, you can, you can

[Outro: Pat Monahan]
Call me sir
What would I ever do without you?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
What would I ever do without you? (Call me sir)
What would I ever do without you?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
Call me sir
What would I ever do without you?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
What would I ever do without you? (Call me sir)
What would I ever do without you?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
Call me sir

[Intro]
Ho, ho, ho
Shake up the happiness
Wake up the happiness
Shake up the happiness
It's Christmas time

[Verse]
There's a story that I was told
And I wanna tell the world
Before I get too old
And don't remember it
So let's December it
And reassemble it (oh yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To fill the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list

[Chorus]
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
Ho, Ho, Ho
Ho, Ho, Ho
It's Christmas time

[Verse]
At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say:

"I got dreams, and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness
With my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Give my grandma a reason to smile
'Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can open some happiness with me"

[Chorus]
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time

[Bridge]
I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where
Your boots have been
I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
Their love will grow and
They believe again

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time

Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
It's Christmas time

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time

Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
It's Christmas time

[Verse 1: Patrick Monahan & Ashley Monroe]
Haven't seen you since high school
Good to see you're still beautiful
Gravity hasn't started to pull
Quite yet I bet you're rich as hell
One that's five and one that's three
Been two years since he left me
Good to know that you got free
That town I know was keeping you down on your knees

[Chorus 1: Patrick Monahan & both]
These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to let you in again
You're not alone in how you've been
Everybody loses, we all got bruises
We all got bruises

[Verse 2:  Patrick Monahan & Ashley Monroe, both]
Have you seen him? Not in years
How about her? No, but I hear
She's in Queens with the man of her dreams
Funny back then she said that about you
Que sera, you'll never guess who I saw
Remember Johnny B?
Remember him we were best friends, practically
Let's do this soon again, ten years is that what it's been?
Can't believe how time flies by
Leaving you makes me wanna cry

[Chorus 1: Patrick Monahan & both]
These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to let you in again
You're not alone in how you've been
Everybody loses, we all got bruises
We all got bruises

[Bridge: Patrick Monahan, Ashley Monroe, both]
I would love to fix it all for you
I would love to fix you too
Please don't fix a thing whatever you do

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Monahan]
These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to know you've got a friend
But you remember now and then
Everybody loses

[Chorus 1: Patrick Monahan, Ashley Monroe, both]
These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to let you in again
You're not alone in how you've been
Everybody loses
Everybody loses
Everybody loses
We all got bruises
We all got bruises
We all got bruises

[Verse 1]
I need a sign to let me know you're here
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere
I need to know that things are gonna look up
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup
When there is no place safe
And no safe place to put my head
When you feel the world shake
From the words that are said

[Chorus]
And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up

[Verse 2]
I need a sign to let me know you're here
'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear
I want a reason for the way things have to be
I need a hand to help build up
Some kind of hope inside of me

[Chorus]
And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

[Bridge]
When children have to play inside
So they don't disappear
While private eyes solve marriage lies
'Cause we don't talk for years
And football teams are kissing queens
And losing sight of having dreams
In a world that what we want
Is only what we want until it's ours

[Chorus]
And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

[Chorus]
And I'm calling all angels
(I won't give up if you don't give up)
(I won't give up if you don't give up)
And calling all you angels
(I won't give up if you don't give up)
(I won't give up if you don't give up)

[Outro]
Calling all you angels
(I won't give up if you don't give up) [Repeat 'til fade]

[Verse 1]
She said I'm not somebody who likes the game
So don't expect me to chase you babe
If you ain't sweet like aspartame
Let me get the door for ya
If you want a back and forth thang
Go and get yourself a boomerang
If you don't like the bacon I bring
Let me get the door for ya

[Verse 2]
She said I can love you like you never been
And keep you going just like ritalin
But if you ain't a working man
Let me get the door for ya

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love...
She said if ya don't like it
I'm in love...
Let me get the door for ya
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love...
She said if ya don't like it
I'm in love...
Let me get the door for ya

[Verse 3]
I said I ain't like them other men
Who think they matter cause they own a Benz
They left you sick, I'm your medicine
Let me get the door for ya
And baby let me ease your mind
I know you been working over time
And if you wanna leave behind the 9 to 5
And see inside a real man
Let me get the door for ya

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love...
She said if ya don't like it
I'm in love...
Let me get the door for ya
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love...
She said if ya don't like it
I'm in love...
Let me get the door for ya

[Bridge]
There's the door if you don't like it
There's the door if you don't like it
There's the door if you don't like it
If you don't like bet you're gonna like it

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love...
I'm in love...
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love...
She said if ya don't like it
I'm in love...
Let me get the door for ya
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love with a working girl
I'm in love...
She said if ya don't like it
I'm in love...
Let me get the door for ya

[Verse 1]
While everybody else is getting out of bed
I'm usually getting in it
I'm not in it to win it
And there's a thousand ways you can skin it
My feet have been on the floor
Flat like an Idol singer
Remember Winger
I digress
I confess you are the best thing in my life
But I'm afraid when I hear stories
About husband and wife
There's no happy endings
No Henry Lee
But you are the greatest thing about me

[Chorus]
If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me

[Verse 2]
Took a loan on a house I own
Can't be a queen bee without a bee throne
I want to buy ya everything
Except cologne
'Cause it's poison
We can travel to Spain
Where the rain falls mainly on the plain
Sounds insane
Because it is, we can laugh, we can sing
Have ten kids and give them everything
Hold our cell phones up in the air
And just be glad that we made it here alive
On a spinning ball in the middle of space
I love you from your toes to your face

[Chorus]
If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me

[Verse 3]
You can move in
I won't ask where you've been
Because everybody has a past
When we're older
We'll do it all over again
When everybody else is getting out of bed
I'm usually getting in it
I'm not in it to win it
I'm in it for you

[Bridge]
If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever
Then the rest is just whatever

[Chorus]
If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for me

[Verse 1]
I used to love the Tenderloin
Until I made some tender coin
Then I met some ladies from Marin
We took the highway to the One
Up the coast to catch some sun
They left me with these blisters on my skin

Don't know what I was on
But I think it grows in Oregon
So I kept on going, going, gone, right through
I drove into Seattle rain
Fell in love then missed the train
That could've took me right back home to you

[Hook]
I've been high
I've been low
I've been "yes," and I been "oh, hell no"
I've been rock 'n roll and disco
Won't you save me, San Francisco?

Oo oo oo...oh oh
Oo oo oo oo ooo ooo

[Verse 2]
Every day's so caffeinated
I wish they were Golden Gated
Fillmore couldn't feel more miles away
So, wrap me up return to sender
Let's forget this 5 year bender
Take me to my city by the Bay

I never knew all that I had
Now Alcatraz don't sound so bad
At least they'd have a hella fine merlot
If I could wish upon a star
I would hitch a cable car
To the place that I can always call my home

[Hook]
I've been high
I've been low
I've been "yes," and I been "oh, hell no"
I been rock 'n roll and disco
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
I've been up
I've been down
I've been so damn lost since you're not around
I've been reggae and calypso
Won't you save me, San Francisco?

[Verse 3]
To tell you the truth
I miss everything, everything
It's a wild, wide, beautiful world
But there's a wide-eyed girl back there
And she means everything, everything

[Hook]
I've been stop
I've been go
I've been "yes" and I been "oh, hell no"
I've been rock 'n roll and disco
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
I've been up
I've been down
I've been so damn lost since you're not around
I've been reggae and calypso
Won't you save me, San Francisco?

Oo oo oo...oh oh
(Won't you save me, San Francisco?)
Oo oo oo...oh oh
Won't you save me, San Francisco?
Oo oo oo...oh oh
(Won't you save me, San Francisco?)
Oo oo oo...oh oh
Won't you save me, San Francisco?

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded?
And that heaven is overrated
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly
So he never did land
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
Tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?
Can you imagine no love
Pride, deep-fried chicken?
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance?
Freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had and me
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way?
And tell me did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded?
And that heaven is overrated
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself?
Na na na
And did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day?
Na na na
And did you fall for a shooting star?
Fall for a shooting star
Na na na
And now you're lonely looking for yourself out there

[Verse 1]
My funny valentine
I know what's on your mind
I know that you cry sometimes
Ooh, oh, oh

Baby, it's all in your head
Do you remember what I said?
When we sat there on your bed
Ooh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
That I, I'm never gonna tell ya' lies
I'll always stand by your side
So when're ya' gonna realize?

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna say goodbye
I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause, baby, you're my valentine

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby, if you knew
I would do anything for you
Even when I'm old and blue
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Gonna prove it everyday
All night in every way
Gonna show you what I say
Is true, ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
That I, I'm never gonna tell ya' lies
I'll always stand by your side
So when're ya' gonna realize?

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna say goodbye
I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause, baby, you're my valentine
'Cause, baby, you're my valentine
'Cause, baby, you're my valentine
'Cause, baby, you're my valentine

[Pre-Chorus]
And I, I'm never gonna tell ya' lies
I'll always stand by your side
So when're ya' gonna realize?

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna say goodbye
I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause, baby, you're my valentine
'Cause, baby, you're my valentine
'Cause, baby, you're my valentine

[Verse 1]
It was just an ordinary Wednesday night
11:47, when the stars aligned
Saw your face, and then I felt the butterflies
Someone's gonna fall in love tonight
If you let me take you to my special place
I can make sure everybody knows your name
Don't regret the things you do or things you say
Even if you did it for the fame

[Chorus]
Can't let this moment
This moment slip away
'Cause things like this don't happen to us every day
So take this moment
And put it in a glass
If you want a sip, I got memories on tap
Drink up, drink up
Write your name on a cup
Drink up, drink up
Write your name on a cup

[Verse 2]
Sitting on the roof of someone else's car
Wrapped up in a blanket of the brightest stars
Hoping either one of us will go too far
Feeling for each other in the dark

[Chorus]
Can't let this moment
This moment slip away
'Cause things like this don't happen to us everyday
So take this moment
And put it in a glass
If you want a sip, I got memories on tap
Drink up, drink up
Write your name on a cup
Drink up, drink up
Write your name on a cup

[Bridge]
This is the night when everything is right
Yeah, when the stars align
This is the night, been waiting all my life
To put your name right next to mine

[Chorus]
Can't let this moment
This moment slip away
'Cause things like this don't happen to us everyday
So take this moment
And put it in a glass
If you want a sip, I got memories on tap
Drink up, drink up
Write your name on a cup
Drink up, drink up
Write your name on a cup

[Verse 1]
In '85, Tuesday morning
Came alive, I didn't know ya
Route 66 is gone
And Reagan's here, it won't be long
Nintendo comes, Live Aid, too
Back to the Future, where were you?
While I spent all my days in Catholic school?
In '89, the dream begins
First in line to California
Pete Rose is banned for good
The Simpsons come to Hollywood
Russia leaves Afghanistan, Flight 103 ends Pan Am
Bush is here, this is the year
That I feel most alone

[Chorus]
No more counting down the hours
No more wishing you were here
I stopped believing
Although Journey told me don't
Before I call it a day
Maybe this will be my year

[Verse 2]
In '92, a boy is born
The skies were blue in Ohio
Boris Yeltsin chills
Freddie dies, but Queen is still
Barcelona has the games
Lady Di is single again
Clinton wins and I still dream
That I'll find you someday
In '97, a baby girl
Adds some heaven to the world
Tony Blair tips the scales
Elton sings for the Princess of Wales
Microsoft buys into Mac
My dad has a second heart attack
And Train leaves San Francisco
In a thousand-dollar van

[Chorus]
No more counting down the hours
No more wishing you were here
I stopped believing
Although Journey told me don't
Before I call it a day
Maybe this will be my year

[Verse 3]
2001, the towers fell
The World is stunned, I wish I knew ya
I was on a plane, the world would never be the same
The artificial heart is born
Ironic when New York's is torn out
2004, began in May
On tour when I met ya
Facebook joins the Internet
Oldsmobile joins the cassette
I met your family
It took a while until you kissed me
But when you did
I finally felt at home

[Bridge]
I stopped believing
Although Journey told me don't
Before I call it a day
Maybe this will be my year

[Outro]
2012 and all I know
Is everybody comes and goes
Everybody sings and cries
Makes the grade and takes the prize
In something, nothing, I don't care
Because I always know that you'll be here
With me

[Verse 1]
When it rains it pours and opens doors
And floods the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dry
And in the midst of sailing ships we sink our lips into the ones we love
That have to say goodbye

[Chorus]
And as I float along this ocean
I can feel you like a notion that won't seem to let me go
And when I look to the sky something tells me you're here with me
And you make everything alright
And when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with me
And I can always find my way when you are here

[Verse 2]
And every word I didn't say that caught up in some busy day
And every dance on the kitchen floor we didn't have before
And every sunset that we'll miss I'll wrap them all up in a kiss
And pick you up in all of this when I sail away

[Chorus]
While I float along this ocean
I can feel you like a notion that I hope will never leave
Cause when I look to the sky something tells me you're here with me
And you make everything alright
And when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with me
And I can always find my way when you are here

[Verse 3]
Whether I am up or down or in or out or just plane overhead
Instead it just feels like it is impossible to fly
But with you I can spread my wings
To see me over everything that life may send me
When I am hoping it won't pass me by

[Chorus]
And when I feel like there is no one that will ever know me
There you are to show me
When I look to the sky something tells me you're here with me
And you make everything alright
And when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with me
And I can always find my way when you are here
I can always find my way

[Chorus 1]
I want you to know that the love
I have for you right now is deep
And real, and right, and it will be
After tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Here comes the winning number
Thunder clapping in the summer skies
'Till confetti comes down
Here comes a kiss, y'all
Wish y'all'd
Open up that Cristal
Baby, 'cause we're moving uptown

[Chorus 2]
Every time you're here with me
It's like I won the lottery
As rich as I could wish to be
It's like I won the lottery

[Chorus 1]
I want you to know that the love
I have for you right now is deep
And real, and right, and it will be
After tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Here comes the winning number
Thunder clapping in the summer skies
Till confetti comes down
Here comes a kiss, y'all
Wish y'all'd
Open up that Cristal
Baby, 'cause we're moving uptown

[Verse 2]
We got the golden ticket
Kick it, hammock and a picket fence
And a pool underground
Take you on a LV spend spree
Open up that Dom P
Baby, cause we're Beverly bound

[Brigde]
Every time you're here with me
It's like I won the lottery
As rich as I could wish to be
It's like I won the lottery

[Chorus 1]
Every time you're here with me
It's like I won the lottery
As rich as I could wish to be
You make me feel free

[Intro]
Just in case I don't make it home
Just in case I don't make it home

[Verse 1]
Are you seeing this?
Was it your breath, or kiss
Upon my neck like this
Just like you took my dying wish
Now I'm all covered in red from your lips
Tweaking from seeking the way to your hips
Schizo from your finger tips
Can't seem to stop this twitch

Are you tuning in?
The crowd is hollering
Jump, jump, jump, jump again
Camera crew is wearing thin
They wanna see me explode upon, emoticon
Oh, don't you see the road I'm on?
I'm real bad, can't quit
Baby, are you seeing this?

[Chorus]
Baby, turn on the news
They're talking about me like I'm going crazy
Baby, turn on the news
Press record when I say it
Just in case I don't make it home

[Verse 2]
Are you following Local 5 or CNN?
They asked me for my next of kin
Oh, I'm a wreck-ening
They think that they should lock me in
A rubber room, and then make sure I don't hurt myself
Or someone else, or even worse, a nurse

Are you getting me?
They think that I'm crazy
But, baby, this cold straight white jacket
Don't even phase me
Oh, I was playing them, tried to give me lithium
Didn't know that I could swim home again
Come on, baby, let me in

[Chorus]
Baby, turn on the news
They're talking about me like I'm going crazy
Baby, turn on the news
Press record when I say it
Just in case I don't make it home

[Post-Chorus]
Just in case I don't make it home
Just in case I don't make it home

[Brigde]
Flashing lights are blinding all my sights
Don't know if I'll make it through the night
When you see me on your screen
Then you'll know just what I mean when I'm saying
Home, home (home, home)

[Chorus]
Baby, turn on the news
They're talking about me like I'm going crazy
Baby, turn on the news
Press record when I say it
Just in case I don't make it home

[Post-Chorus]
Just in case I don't make it home
Just in case I don't make it home

[Verse 1]
Am I made of paper?
Cause I tear so easily
Am I made of vapor?
Because I disappear
Do I have to have a reason
For anything I feel?
Just be glad I'm real, glad I'm real
Am I real?

Are you made of lead paint?
A bulletproof Picasso
All the virgin saints
Put you here to care for me
I don't need a reason
For anything I feel
Jut be glad I say what I mean
I mean what I say to you

[Chorus]
We don't need a reason
For anything we feel
We don't need a reason
Picasso's at the wheel
So roll this top down
Hell with this town
Leave our bags behind
We don't need a reason
Cause I've got you
And you've got me tonight
Cause I've got you
And you've got me tonight

[Verse 2]
Did you ever see the waves break
Into a million pieces?
Or stay awake
With someone who was dying?
You don't need to tell me
Anything at all
I'm just glad you're here, glad you're real
Are you real?

Am I made of timber?
Cause I'm on fire
Will you remember
Tonight for very long?
You don't need to sell me
On anything at all
Just say what you mean
And mean what you say to me

[Chorus]
We don't need a reason
For anything we feel
We don't need a reason
Picasso's at the wheel
So roll this top down
Hell with this town
Leave our bags behind
We don't need a reason
Cause I've got you
And you've got me tonight

[Bridge]
Amber waves of grain
Fly by highway lanes
Waited for this change
Seems like my entire life
If only the good die young
We'll outlast everyone
For some of the things we've done
And we've just begun

[Chorus]
We don't need a reason
For anything we feel
We don't need a reason
Picasso's at the wheel
So roll this top down
Hell with this town
Leave our bags behind
We don't need a reason
Cause I've got you
And you've got me tonight
And you've got me tonight
You've got me tonight
You've got me tonight

[Verse 1]
Knock knock, who's there?
2012 is a brand new year
Cleaning house, singing songs
Shedding light and righting wrongs
Ding dong, the witch ain't dead
She's still trying to take my bread
Four more years 'til my girls all gone
Then the bitch gonna have to leave me alone
It's all good because i'm as happy as a flea
On a mountain of dogs, you see
A little music cured all the hurt and put hate in six feet of dirt

[Chorus]
I was looking for some heaven
There's no need to look no more
California 37
Took me right to heaven's door
Knock knock, woah oh
Rock and roll
California 37 took me right to heaven's door

[Verse 2]
Here's to those who didn't think Train could ever roll again
You were the fuel that I used when inspiration hit a dead end
San Francisco got it done, 415 took the 911
Thank you all for believing in
We won't let you down again
Truth is, it was attitude
Replaced greed with gratitude
Then replaced a pretty key dude
It's all truth not being rude
Making love now, not mistakes
Working hard instead of looking for breaks
Came all the way from the eighth great lake
And found 37 reasons to stay

[Chorus]
I was looking for some heaven
There's no need to look no more
California 37
Took me right to heaven's door
Knock knock, woah oh
Rock and roll
California 37 took me right to heaven's door

[Outro]
I was looking for some heaven
There's no need to look no more
California 37
Took me right to heaven's door

Sometimes you want your money back, then some
Sometimes you wonder if these things have ever been done
Sometimes you get a little bit too high, see?
That love ain't free

I'll say it louder, so the back can hear
It ain't about money, so have no fear
"But it takes a little change, and change is good"
That's what mama said, 'cause she understood

A man is just a man, but a woman's a queen
Now I finally understand what she needs
It's real simple, if your woman is good
The sky is the limit, but what you could be

Two quarters, a dime, and a silver dollar
Make me wanna call her
Make me wanna follow her to the end of the line
Make her mine
Two quarters, a dime, and a silver dollar
Ch-ch-change my mind

Sometimes girls just wanna have fun
Sometimes the honey might get you stung
Sometimes you get a little bit too low to know
Where love can go

I'll sing it louder, so the back can dance
It ain't about money, so there's still a chance
"But it takes a little change, and change is good"
That's what mama said, 'cause she understood

Two quarters, a dime, and a silver dollar
Make me wanna call her
Make me wanna follow her to the end of the line
Make her mine
Two quarters, a dime, and a silver dollar
Ch-ch-change my mind

Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Hallelujah, since I knew ya'
Everything is coming up, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
A little change'll do ya' good
Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Hallelujah, since I knew ya'
Everything is coming up, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
A little change'll do ya' good

Two quarters, a dime, and a silver dollar
Make me wanna call her
Make me wanna follow her to the end of the line
Make her mine
Two quarters, a dime, and a silver dollar
Ch-ch-change my mind

Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Hallelujah, since I knew ya'
Everything is coming up, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
A little change'll do ya' good
Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Hallelujah, since I knew ya'
Everything is coming up, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
A little change'll do ya' good

[Verse 1]
Don't cry when I die
When it's my time I probably won't die
I'll just lie down and close my eyes
And think about stuff
These eyes got too wide seen too much of life's goodbyes
Should have spent less time making loot
And spent more time in my birthday suit with you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And everybody upstairs, everybody downstairs
I'm not gonna have time to hang out with them

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I'll be hanging out with you
Not Jimi Hendrix, Jesus or the dude
Who played the sherriff in Blazing Saddles
You not Chris Farley Mr. Rodgers oh I've waited so long
You can finally meet my Mom

[Verse 2]
Life is good, but love it's better
Even Bieber ain't forever
We all got to go you know
So you might as well go in style

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Everybody praying, everybody singing
I'm not gonna have time to hang out with them

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I'll be hanging out with you
Not Gilda Radner, Buddha or the dude
Who had pop rocks and soda at the same time
You, not Jesse James, Paul Newman and oh I've waited so long
You can finally meet my Mom

[Bridge]
I'm not making light of things
But who's to say who's right with things like this
There's so much that we miss
Tryin' so hard to be rich and famous
Pretty and thin, to win
It's a shame that youth is wasted on the young

[Pre-Chorus 3]
So forget everything and just be with me here now
For as long as we can and whoever goes first save a spot

[Chorus 3]
You, not Etta James, Bob Marley or the girls who won my heart along the way
You, not Sitting Bull, Ella or Bach and I almost forgot
You can finally meet my Mom

[Verse 3]
No Steve Jobs, or Ty Cobbs, Al Capone or any other mobs
No Whitney Houston, no Chet Baker, Andre the Giant or the Undertaker, just you

[Outro]
You can finally meet my Mom [x4]

Whose eyes am I behind?
I don't recognize anything that I see
Whose skin is this design?
I don't want this to be the way that you see me

I don't understand anything anymore
And this web that I'm tied up
Is taking me right up these walls
That I climb up
To get to your story
It's anything but ordinary

And when the world is on its knees
With me, it's fine
And when I come to the rescue
I get nothing but left behind
Everybody seems to be getting what they need
Where's mine?
'Cause you're what I need so very
But I'm anything but ordinary

Can you save me from this world of mine
Before I get myself arrested with this expectation
You are the one
Look what you've done
What have you done?
This is not some kind of joke
You're just a kid
You weren't ready for what you did, no

And when the world is on its knees
With me, it's fine
And when I come to the rescue
I do it for you
Time after time
Everybody seems to be getting what they need
Where's mine?
'Cause you're what I need so very
But I'm anything but ordinary

I think I'm trying to save the world for you
You've been saving me, too
We could just stay in and save each other

[Outro]
I'm anything but ordinary
I'm anything but ordinary

I wish that I had all the answers
And I could walk you down your road
For all the times, those times you feel like you don't matter
There's just one thing you gotta know

You better believe, you better believe
Like my father said to me
"Just give it some time, look for a sign
And you'll be just fine"

They say that nothing lasts forever
They say that good times fade away
And I know, I know that sometimes it ain't easy
But I know you'll be okay

One day I'll see you in the future
You have a family of your own
I will be there, I will be there to be your teacher
You better believe, you better believe you're not alone

You better believe, you better believe
Like my father said to me
"Just give it some time, look for a sign
And you'll be just fine"

They say that nothing lasts forever
They say that good times fade away
And I know, I know that sometimes it ain't easy
But I know you'll be okay

You better believe
You better believe
You better believe no matter where you are
You better believe
You better believe
Even when you don't believe I won't be far

It's true that nothing lasts forever
We all become a memory
But I know, I know one day we'll be together
Together again, you better believe, you better believe

You better believe
You better believe
You better believe no matter where you are
You better believe
You better believe
Even when you don't believe I won't be far
